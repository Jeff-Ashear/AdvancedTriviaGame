1. Purpose for this app:

    	This app is a simple trivia game, intended to demonstrate facility with timers, jQuery, and switch statements. 


2. How the app is organized:

        The index.html file feeds the single page to the browser.
        All the game logic happens in app.js.
        Once the user begins the game a timer will start.  If the timer reaches 0 before the user enters an answer, it counts as incorrect.  If the questions is answered before the timer ends and the answer is scored.  This begins a new timer to allow the user to absorb the feedback.  Once this timer reaches 0 the cycle repeats for each additional question.
        Once the game is over, a reward screen appears as well as the option to restart the game.
